* divide string to List<string> - get all not empty, not commented  rows
  so List<string>(string)
* read all pseudocommands, write their keyValue to table and remove them from list
  so List<string>(List<string>()). 
  Validation: there is shouldn`t be any duplication of same Pseudocommands. 
  If there is - fail validation.
